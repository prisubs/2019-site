	<p class="description">I'm an undergrad at Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in the College of Engineering. I love eating Taco Bell and solving problems, sometimes simultaneously.</p>

	<h2 class="header blue">currently</h2>
	<p class="description">Investing in early-stage, university-based companies at <a href="https://contrarycap.com">Contrary Capital</a> and working as a summer analyst in the Alpha-DIG quant research group at <a href="https://www.db.com/company/index.htm">Deutsche Bank</a>. I'm also Berkeley's campus ambassador for <a href="https://accelerated.carrd.co">Accelerated VC</a>.</p>

	<h2 class="header orange">formerly</h2>
	<p class="description">In Fall 2018, I worked on web-scraping architecture design and computational text analysis with the<a href="https://github.com/URAP-charter"> Charter Schools Project</a> as an undergraduate researcher at Berkeley's Haas School of Business. In past summers, I've worked at <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/memeois/id1237691962?mt=8">Memeois</a>, <a href="https://girlswhocode.com"> Girls Who Code</a>, <a href="https://humon.io"> Humon</a>, and <a href="https://www.suneelgupta.com"> Gupta For Congress</a>. In Summer 2016, I attended <a href="https://launchx.com">MIT Launch</a>, a selective summer entrepreneurship accelerator, and developed an enterprise waste management tool.</p>

	<h2 class="header green">teaching</h2>
	<p class="description">I love teaching computer science, and I have been since 2016. I've taught with Juni Learning, Girls Who Code, NSF, Detroit Startup Week, and given a number of guest lectures. I also started <a href="https://littlebytes19.carrd.co">LittleBytes</a>, which runs programming summer camps.</p>

	<h2 class="header purple">life</h2>
	<p class="description">I run a <a href="https://instagram.com/abpsveg">vegetarian + paleo cooking account</a>. You can find me running, at CycleBar or CorePower, or in the pool most of the time.
